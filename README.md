## Introduction

Laravel Builder provides configuration files for connecting a laravel site with Builder

```bash

composer require rs/laravel-builder --dev

php artisan builder:install
```

## CMS Dir

After installation there will be a cms directory in the root of your project which will contain an example routes file and a views directory. 
There is also a config file where you can disable automatic route registration if it needs to be custom. The config file can be found ``config/builder.php``
